This project is a 4HP fork of the Voxmachina chacha VCLFO eurorack module.

## Status: Confirmed working!

## Hardware and PCB

I had it in my head to do this in 4hp, but it was quite a pain.
In the end i had to fit a lot of standing resistors which I usually dislike but i think
I spaced them in a way that wasn't too confusing.

You can simply order the pcbs as-is on any pcb manufacturing site, 
I use jlcpcb. You can order all the pcbs with the standard settings.

The build is relatively straight forward, apart from the standing resistors which are kind of annoying.

# Tuning
I simplified the sin shaping circuit so there is only one trimmer (for the saw shaper).
As for how to tune it, check out [voxmachina's videos on the module on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsVzbcYWhuM&t=31s).
