# Kra Pao
## Eurorack DIY LPG/VCA/VCF

"Kra Pao" is a resonant low pass gate at is core, though it can function in three different modes, as a VCA, a LPG or a VCF (Low Pass).

It has two modulation inputs, one unipolar and other bipolar.

On its own the module can resonate, it won't follow v/oct standard but it can be played.
