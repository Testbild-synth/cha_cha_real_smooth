"Tom Yum" is a saw core voltage controlled oscillator based on old analogue synth designs, it produces four waveforms, Sine, Saw, Square and Triangle.

It has two v/oct inputs, one FM modulation input and a Sync input as well.

The sync input, unlike most sync inputs, accepts any kind of signal, LFO, audio rate Square Wave, Sine wave, etc.

### Build
Open the BOM file to see all required components alongside some notes as well, then proceed to open the pdf with the Build Instructions and go step by step until calibration.

On the guide you will find how to calibrate the waves and the pitch (v/oct).

Feel free to also contact me if you're interested in buying the PCB sets or buy a fully assembled one as well.

### Specs

* 12HP
* 15mA (+/-12v)
